            <p class="quote uppercase">Project Overview</p>
            <p>"Jules" is a Puzzle-Adventure game where players must reactivate the functions of machines
                in a gigantic library divided into 4 sectors. Each sector will feature a number "x" of rooms, in
                each of which players will face an environmental puzzle using the protagonist's unique ability
                to transfer energy from one machine or object to another, thereby activating and deactivating
                their functions accordingly.</p>

                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gauntlet Mechanic:</strong> A key feature of Jules is the use of a specialized glove for interacting with
                        objects.Many objects in the game are designed to respond to the light. When players
                        shine light on these objects, they collect and store the light energy. Each object has a
                        specific light threshold it needs to reach. Once the required number of light
                        interactions is achieved, the object activates and begins to perform its intended
                        behavior or function.</li>
                    <li><strong>environmental progression :</strong> The continuous progression of the environment each time you complete a puzzle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light Interactables :</strong> Different objects that are activated only through the reception of lights.
                        Players can interact with objects by activating and deactivating their functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Base Interaction:</strong> Inside the game there are sheets of paper where the player will discover parts of the
                        narrative by interacting with them.</li>

            <section class="description-section">
                <p><strong>The House Scatter Tool combines real-time visualization, snapping mechanics, and optimized object placement to improve level design workflows. Its UI-based prefab selection and intuitive controls ensure a seamless experience. Below are the key mechanics that define how the tool functions.</strong></p>
                <h4>Additional information:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Player Input and Movement:</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Gauntlet Mechanic:</strong>Created the glove mechanic, which is a central feature of the game.
                        Design: Developing the glove as an interactive tool for manipulating light and objects within
                        the game.
                        Animations: Implementing animations for the glove, including its activation, light emission,
                        and interaction with objects. Ensured that the animations were smooth and visually coherent
                        with the game’s aesthetic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light Interactables:</strong>Developed the light mechanic, including the creation and management of light.
                        Light Creation: Implemented the functionality for the glove to take and give light onto
                        various objects.
                        Animations: Designed and integrated animations for light interactions, ensuring that light
                        transitions and effects were visually appealing and integrated seamlessly into the gameplay.
                        Added ring animations that allow the player to understand how many lights the object needs
                        to function</li>
                    <li><strong>Object Behaviors with Light Interaction:</strong> Worked on defining and programming the different behaviors of interactive objects that
                        respond to light.
                        These include:
                        Altar: Implemented an altar that serves as a repository for collected lights. This object
                        accumulates light and plays a role in gameplay progression by storing and managing light
                        resources.
                        Light Door: Created a door that opens and closes based on the number of light interactions.
                        The door’s movement is triggered when the required light threshold is met.

                        Generator: Created a generator that activates additional light-interactive objects once it
                        receives the correct amount of light.
                        Moving Platform: Designed a platform that moves along a spline path once it receives the
                        correct amount of light.
                        Rotating Platform: Created a rotating platform that can rotate around any axis once it
                        receives the correct amount of light.
                        Sequence Altar: altars that must be activated with a specific sequence to activate their
                        behavior</li>

                    <li><strong>Base Interactive System:</strong>Created a system of basic interactive objects that help players better understand the
                        narrative. </li>
                    <li><strong>Gauntlet Power-Ups:</strong>
                        Power-Up Design: Created various power-ups that provide temporary enhancements or
                        new abilities for the gauntlet, such as the number of storing lights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Player Health:</strong>Managed the health system for the player, including:
                        Health States: Implemented health status tracking, including the player's health, death
                        state, and respawn mechanics.
                        Death and Respawn: Developed the system to handle player death, including triggering
                        respawn sequences and managing game states during these transitions.
                        Death Animations: Added animations for player death to enhance the visual impact of
                        dying in the game. These animations help convey the consequences of player failure and
                        provide feedback to the player.</li>

                    <li><strong>Damage System:</strong>Implemented the damage system, which is intricately linked to the player health
                        management:
                        Damage Mechanics: Designed and programmed mechanics for handling damage inflicted
                        on the player, including sources of damage and how it affects the player's health.</li>

                    <li><strong>Camera Shake and Camera Management:</strong>
                        Camera Shake: Implemented camera shake effects to simulate player walking.
                        Camera Manager: Developed a camera management system to control camera behavior,
                        including transitions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Visual Effects (VFX):</strong>
                        VFX: Designed and integrated visual effects to enhance gameplay and feedback, including
                        light effects, environmental effects, and interactive object responses.</li>

                    <li><strong>Sound Management:</strong></li>

                    <li><strong>Save System Implementation:</strong>Designed and implemented the save system for the game:
                        Progress Saving: Ensured that player progress, including collected items, activated objects,
                        and game states, is saved accurately.
                        Restore Functionality: Developed the restore functionality to allow players to resume their
                        game from the most recent save point without losing significant progress.</li>

                    <li><strong>Menu Settings and Resolution Options:</strong>Implemented the settings menu that allows players to customize their gameplay experience.
                        This included:
                        Resolution Settings: Provided options for players to adjust the game’s resolution based on
                        their preferences and device capabilities.</li>
